# CPP Digit Memorization Game

This program generates a given number of random digits and then provides the user with 2 seconds to memorize them.
After that, the screen is cleared, and the user is prompted to enter the digits that were shown to them.
If the entered digits match the original ones, the user wins; otherwise, they lose and have to play again.

## Usage
To use this program, please follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the main.cpp file using any C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable generated by the compiler.
4. Enter the length of the random digit sequence you want to generate. The digit should be between 2 to 9.
5. Wait for the program to generate the random digit sequence.
6. Try to memorize the randomly generated digits for the next 2 seconds.
7. After 2 seconds, the screen will be cleared, and you will be asked to enter the digits you remember seeing earlier.
8. If you enter the correct digits, you win. If not, you lose and have to play again.
9. You will be prompted to play again. Enter 'y' to continue playing or 'n' to exit.
